# GAMMORA REPOSITORY

**GAMMORA** : **GA**te **M**onte-Carlo **MO**del for **RA**diotherapy

Coming soon.... (winter 2020)

A full Varian TrueBeam Model for [Gate v9.0](https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate) with the following features:
- Conversion DICOM RT PLAN to GATE macros (including dynamic plans such as VMAT, DCA...)
- open-source particle gun corresponding to the real machine ('GAN' neural network trained on the data furnished by [myVarian](https://www.myvarian.com/), created using [GAGA](https://github.com/dsarrut/gaga))
- full geometry (MLC, jaws...). As the real geometry is confidential, the proposed model is slightly different than the real machine (but same dosmetric properties) 
- absolute dose conversion
